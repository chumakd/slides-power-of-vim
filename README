The Power of Vim
================

The idea behind this slides is to provide overview and reference of most useful
vim commands, many of which are not known to or forgotten by the average vim
users. It also describes a "must have" and "best of" vim plugins
(general-purpose and targeted for C/C++ programming) of my choice.
